        I designed the user interface for this event management platform using
        HTML and CSS, creating a clean and user-friendly experience for managing
        and attending events. The platform enables users to register, create and
        manage events, and handle ticket sales with secure Stripe payment
        integration. It features a paperless system with unique ticket codes,
        robust dispute resolution, and a commission-based payout structure.
        Focused on privacy and security, it holds payments until event
        completion and ensures a seamless transaction experience without
        start-up costs. Here are just a few sample screens: home page, login,
        register, event detail, event list, and add new event.
